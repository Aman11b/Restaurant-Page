## ☕ Classic-Themed Cafe Website
Welcome to the Classic Cafe project! This is a simple yet charming cafe website designed to highlight dynamic content rendering using JavaScript.

## ✨ Key Feature: Fully Dynamic Content Rendering
All pages on this website are dynamically rendered to keep things fresh and flexible. Here's what that means:

## 📜 Modular Page Updates: Every section—from the home page to contact—is generated dynamically, making it super easy to update without diving into HTML files.

## 🎨 Efficient Asset Management: Images, icons, and text are injected dynamically, allowing for quick content changes and a modular structure.

## ⚙️ Smooth Webpack Integration: Built with Webpack, the project ensures optimized asset loading and smooth performance, keeping your cafe experience seamless.

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is a practice implementation, focusing on JavaScript and Webpack skills while creating a classic-themed cafe website that’s easy to modify and update!
